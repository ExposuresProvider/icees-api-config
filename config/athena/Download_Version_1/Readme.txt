NB: the codes and files in this version was not the final version that was used to download the athena files.
The final version that was used is in folder named "Download_version_1"

I think the codes are still useful in this folder as it goes back to the initial idea to download every thing from athena website for each variables in steps described in download_athena_file.py. By everything i mean all the domains (e.g. Drugs, Condition, Prodedure e.t.c) and vocabs (e.g. RxNorm, LOINC e.t.c) with or without specifying them. 

Vocab.txt and Domain.txt is a full list of domains and vocabs on Athena webiste.


download_athena_file.py can be ran as a cran job using download.sh
